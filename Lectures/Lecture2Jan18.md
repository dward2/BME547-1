# Python Fundamentals

Approach to coding:  sequential, object, state machine, modular

Use a text editor for now, talk about development environments later

Start with simple code -> Modules (collection of functional items)
->Package (bundles of modules) -> Classes (object oriented)

Make a new repository from gitbash (mkdir, cd to new dir, git init)

Vim fun.py

## Python Starter Notes
* Python uses indentation--not semicolons and curly braces--to delineate
  different logical aspects of code.
```
if BOOLEAN_IS_TRUE:
    do_this()
else:
    do_that()
    and_this()

test_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
test_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']

for n, val in enumerate(test_tuple):
    print(val)
    print(n)
    print(test_tuple[n])

```
Not a fixed number of spaces, just have to be consistent.

Let's adopt a style for this course.  

[Pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ "PEP 8")

Other styles exist such as google style.  Also have syntax checkers to run.

Define 'main' - description without algorithmic function

```

   def main():
```

Define subfunctions
       add_two()
       subtract_two()
       multiply_two()
       
**style to use verbs for functions**
       
 Now work functions.
 
 def add_two(), etc.
 
 placeholders with comments (""")
 
 Docstring indicated for comments but also to assemble documentations later on.

For example, :param v1: number one, :param v2: number 2, :returns: product number

using colons is shorthand for docstring to indicate a variable

**key for medical software**

This approach ensures documentation is generated at the same time as code and not a document constructed later.

add info to def of sub function (v1,v2)

Now add an if statement 

```

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

double underscore, internal python variable that is protected.  Shouldn't mess with it.

conditional statement says that if I'm running the proram called main, then this true

then call the main function.  

```
The __name__ variable is something automatically set by the Python
interpreter based on the file that is being executed.  When this script is
being directly executed from the command line, __name__ is set equal to 
__main__; 
```

when that happens, this conditional statement then executes the
main() function defined above.  

**You need these two lines to get your program to run as a script from the command line.**

Now add v1,v2 to other def's, add some numbers to main ex:  add_two(4,5)

A lot of intfrastructure here for basic functions but will let use do more, including defining testing functions

Usually just cross fingers, hit run and see how it goes.  Fine for just me but more complexity, more people need a more robust way.

Now add functions

```
p= v1 + v2, etc.

```

consider issues such as v1 - v2 (add to documntation); what if a string is entered, etc.

What about use of p?  Let's add some print(p) statements for now.  Otherwise have to indicate that we will return this value.

return p

**will this run?**

Let's try add, commit...

run by typing: python fun.py

***nope!***

Need to add python to path

switch to home directory ~

VIM .bashrc and

```
export PATH=/path/to/python/bin/:$PATH
```

then source ~/.bashrc to run it

Also need to setup a virtual environment

You need to make sure that `python` and `pip` are available as executable
commands from your command line environment.  This will typically involve
appending the path to your python executables to your `PATH` environmental
variable.  One common way this is done in a bash shell enviroment is to add the
following line to your `$HOME/.bashrc` file:
```
export PATH=/path/to/python/bin/:$PATH
```
:warning: Do not forget the `$PATH` at the end; this makes sure that all of
your previous executable paths are still accessible!

Then make sure you have the most up to date `pip`:

For Mac/Linux:
```
pip install -U pip
```
For Windows (using your `Command Window`, not `Git Bash`):
```
python -m pip install -U pip
```
Then install the virtual environment creation tool called `virtualenv`.
```
pip install virtualenv
```
or
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


To create a new virtualenv in a project you're working on, first change
directory (`cd`) to your project directory and run:
```sh
virtualenv myProject           # creates a virtual environment called "myProject" in your current directory
source myProject/bin/activate  # activates your virtual environment
```
This creates a virtual environemnt "sandbox" that will hold all the
dependencies for your project at their specific versions.

```
python3 -m venv <VirtualEnvironmentName>
```


***Run it again!***

Should work now - check for errors in code.

variations...  bat = multiply_two(5,5)

print('This is the output of multiply_two: {}'.format(bat))

discuss variable type integer, float...etc.
